A picture is worth 1000 bacteria: creating image-based computer tools to support
sustainable production and distribution of drinking water
#################################################
################ Main project goal ################
to facilitate sustainable drinking water production and 
distribution by simplifying end-user integration of image-based 
data from flow cytometry analysis with traditional water quality indicators
############### A first overview ##################
Drinking water is our most essential food and it is required 
for sustainable cities, societies, industries, food production 
and agriculture. The drinking water production and distribution 
systems contain many bacteria, with around 200 000 bacteria per millilitre
 arriving at the consumer’s tap. Flow cytometry (FCM) profiles describe the number,
 cell integrity and DNA content of all the bacteria in a water sample, and can
 measure online, in near-real time. Previous work has shown that FC M describes
 effective biological filtration, correlating with removal of indicator bacteria;
 and can detect infrastructure changes in distribution systems. Based on these 
results, several drinking water treatment plants in Sweden have acquired FCM 
capabilities.
Optimal use of FCM is limited by a lack of computer tools to analyse the 
image-based data sets that are generated. This project combines computer science,
 water microbiology and FCM specialists to create user-friendly FCM data handling
 tools. These will be tested by drinking water treatment plant staff, to allow 
them to compare and correlate their FCM data sets without operator bias, to 
traditional water quality parameters. Facilitating the use of FCM will reduce
 water loss due to flushing following maintenance, inform optimization of 
biological and other filtration processes to reduce chemical and energy use, 
and provide microbiological feedback. Together this will result in safe and 
sustainable drinking water production and delivery.

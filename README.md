Detection of Bacteria in Water

Project Description

Introduction
According the UN’s Agenda 2030, two of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, see Figure 1), directly relate to water quality aspects, that is SDG 6, and SDG 14. The SDGs are claimed to be mutually dependent, that is, they should be seen as an indivisible whole. Certainly, the states of the water-related SDGs have more or less direct effect on other SDGs, and certainly the quality of water constitutes one of the most important. For instance, SDG 6, on clean water has impact on a concrete SDG such as SDG 2 (on hunger and nutrition aspects), as well as on a more abstract and complex SDG, such as SDG 11 (Sustainable cities).
With the SDGs come the SDG targets and indicators, where the targets specify in more detail the meaning by the SDGs, and where the indicators constitutes ways of validating states of goal completion. At (for instance) https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/ the SDGs are presented at levels of targets and indicators, and where in, some cases, it is furthermore pointed out how indicators of different SDGs are interrelated. This in turn motivates that SDGs are interrelated, and furthermore motivates that the SDGs may be seen as an indivisible whole.
Examples (see https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/): - Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all o Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services ▪ Related indicators: All targets under Goal 6, as well as targets 1.2, 1.4, 2.2, 3.2, 3.8, 3.9, 4a, 5.4 and 11.1
- Target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally o Indicator 6.3.1: Proportion of wastewater safely treated o Indicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality ▪ Related indicators: Indicators 6.3.1, 6.6.1, 14.1.1 - Target 14.1: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution o Indicator 14.1.1: Index of coastal eutrophication and floating plastic debris density - Target 14.3: Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels o Indicator 14.3.1: Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations

On project
Computer Science at HKR (CS@HKR) is currently active in a research project concerning Bacteria in Water. This research project corresponds to validating drinking water at drinking water treatment plants, and as such clearly relates to Agenda 2030’s SDG6.
The course project will contribute to both of the research contexts, and deals with analyzing big amounts of data, and present the result in understandable ways. Here, bacteria in water is within the main task of the project. Collections of data will be provided to start with, and those collections will be a starting point of analyses and visualization.
The research context relates to a research project that has been controlled from Lund Institute of Technology (LTH) at Lund University, that CS@HKR is a part of. To have a consistent way of communicating different projects we hereby will call that project the Research Project (in short, RP), and the project of this course will be called the Study Project (in short, SP).
To approach RP, that project will be further described in this text.


On RP
The text of this document will provide a first overview of RP, to put the Study Project within that context. More information will be provided through Appendix 1 and 2. Discussions will also take form during the course.
Title of project
A picture is worth 1000 bacteria: creating image-based computer tools to support
sustainable production and distribution of drinking water
Main project goal
to facilitate sustainable drinking water production and distribution by simplifying end-user integration of image-based data from flow cytometry analysis with traditional water quality indicators
A first overview
Drinking water is our most essential food and it is required for sustainable cities, societies, industries, food production and agriculture. The drinking water production and distribution systems contain many bacteria, with around 200 000 bacteria per millilitre arriving at the consumer’s tap. Flow cytometry (FCM) profiles describe the number, cell integrity and DNA content of all the bacteria in a water sample, and can measure online, in near-real time. Previous work has shown that FC M describes effective biological filtration, correlating with removal of indicator bacteria; and can detect infrastructure changes in distribution systems. Based on these results, several drinking water treatment plants in Sweden have acquired FCM capabilities.
Optimal use of FCM is limited by a lack of computer tools to analyse the image-based data sets that are generated. This project combines computer science, water microbiology and FCM specialists to create user-friendly FCM data handling tools. These will be tested by drinking water treatment plant staff, to allow them to compare and correlate their FCM data sets without operator bias, to traditional water quality parameters. Facilitating the use of FCM will reduce water loss due to flushing following maintenance, inform optimization of biological and other filtration processes to reduce chemical and energy use, and provide microbiological feedback. Together this will result in safe and sustainable drinking water production and delivery.
More on student task
The Study Project will be conducted by students in one project group. Each one will however contribute individually to the project as a whole, and be able to point out one’s own contributions. The Study Project will be discussed about every two weeks with course teachers, and where students shall show progress in requirements, design, implementation, test, and further typical software development process aspects.
The main student task lies in finding ways to contribute to RP. Contributions will here be approached through creative initiatives from the students, as well as through the formal RP participant. Methods for solutions typically relates to material of previous courses of the master program, such as Datamining, Mobile Platforms, and Computer Science Methods for Sustainable Development. As being a part of a research project, the task will be experimental and adjust to upcoming circumstances. The task of the Study Project may also provide a basis for a continuing work during the development of the thesis. NOTE, that results from the Study Project may be a part of research of Computer Science at HKR.
Besides from developing solutions in line with RP, the student task also includes:
- Hand in documents on development process
- Present results at a seminar
- Write a report
- Regard software qualities
The report shall involve
- Project core results
- Related research material, and how research project relates to research material
The report shall prepare for the thesis work, and shall therefore be in line with requirements concerning reports for thesis.
